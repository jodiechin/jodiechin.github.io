## Professional Experience


### Associate Product Manager at Hookit
##### September 2020 - January 2021 
Hookit is a Sponsorship and Valuation platform that provides data to help quantify and track the value of sports sponsorships. As an Associate Product Manager, a key aspect of my position was to design products and features to increase KPI performance. I worked alongside business stakeholders to develop features and product requirement documents and engineers to ensure a smooth execution. After features were commercialized, I tracked feature performance and feedback for possible expansions and improvements. My main focus of projects were on the data science side, helping develop new data models and predictors for Hookit's platform.

### Student Data Analyst at Cal Athletics

As a data analyst at Cal Athletics, I worked closely with the CRM Analytics and Strategy Manager to extract and analyze data, specifically ticket sales data. I would use data platforms such as DOMO to create visualizations and help make data-driven decisions with the Executive team. I also built data analytics reports to compare year to day ticket sales and forecast ticket revenue for the upcoming season.
